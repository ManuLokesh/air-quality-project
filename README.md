# Air Quality Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data from satellite datasets (e.g., MODIS, TROPOMI) and ground-based sensors (CPCB CAAQMS/NAMP). It aims to build pipelines for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization, all implemented in Python on Unix/Linux environments.

## Features
- Download and preprocess satellite and surface measurement data
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Apply statistical methods for air quality insights
- Demonstrate use of high-performance computing tools and Python libraries

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, xarray, netCDF4)
- Linux/Unix environment (macOS terminal)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python environment (instructions to come)
3. Download sample datasets (instructions to come)
4. Run analysis scripts and visualize results
